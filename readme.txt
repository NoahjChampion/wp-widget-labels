Allows you to use custom labels/titles for any of your Widgets

== Description ==

This simple, but useful plugin that lets you control what label shows next to each Widget in your WordPress dashboard. The idea behind is to allow better organization of your widgets, as well as to give you a bit more control and flexibility over this already-built-in WordPress feature.

It's very handy in cases where you'd like your clients to know something before updating a certain widget. We might even change this up in the future and change it up to a `<textarea>` field.

In the meanwhile â€” enjoy, and feel free to contribute / send pull requests our way [over at GitHub](https://github.com/maor/wp-widget-labels).
